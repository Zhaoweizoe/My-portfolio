# My-portfolio
This is my portfolio that I made using HTML and CSS in July 2023

This is the initial draft of the website. It will be further improved after studying the next course, 
and both the text and images will be more suitable. By the time the course is completed, it will become a mature website.

It contains a navbar, images, a video, hover effects and a form.
