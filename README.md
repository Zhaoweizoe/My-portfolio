# My-portfolio
This is my portfolio that I made using HTML and CSS in July 2023

This is the initial draft of the website. It will be further improved after studying the next course, 
and both the text and images will be more suitable. By the time the course is completed, it will become a mature website.

It contains a navbar, images, a video, hover effects and a form.


All the projects from the HTML and CSS course have been completed, and you can view them on my GitHub HTML and CSS projects repository. 
I have created a separate repository for my portfolio to facilitate further modifications once I finish the JavaScript and software development course.
Update on 07/09/2023: I have updated this website using JavaScript. In the slideshow, I inserted the C# SOL image because I plan to learn these languages after completing this course. I didn't upload my own photo because I don't have a satisfactory one, so I inserted an AI picture instead. Perhaps it is not essential to display a personal photo to avoid stereotypes or discrimination. I will discuss this with my career adviser when I finish all the courses.
